"remote = github website"
"local = your PC"

"If you want to bring commits from remote to local, you pull.

If you want to move your commits from local to remote, you push.

Whenever you pull, different commits from different people on different files need to sit together nicely. So, a merge happens. However, if two commits happened on the same file, your local commits will get confused about which commit is the HEAD. This is where a merge-conflict happens. But thatâ€™s a discussion for another day."
